The visitors won 4–1.
Goals and highlights can be watched in the <a href=https://youtu.be/v1YINFSr6wU>onTV Sports review</a>.</p><p>Eastern are the oldest<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> of the current Premier League participants.
The club have been champions of Hong Kong five times:
four times before the establishment of the Premier League (1955–56, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1994–95) and once after (2015–16).
Eastern have also won the FA Cup seven times, including the last two editions of the tournament.</p><p>This year, things have not gone well for the team.
In the AFC Champions League Two, Eastern lost all six matches with a goal difference of 2–30.
They lost 0–7 at home to Thailand’s Ratchaburi and 0–9 away to Vietnam’s Nam Dinh.
Things are no better domestically either: last weekend Lee Man demolished Eastern 8–1.</p><p>North District had beaten Eastern District away 2–0 over the weekend (I didn’t attend that match) and came into this game as favourites — something I’m still not used to (and would rather not get used to).</p><p>The game started dull. It then continued in much the same vein.
North District enjoyed plenty of possession and tried to create danger down the flanks.
The forwards and wingers languished offside, as if they had collectively forgotten the offside rule.
Eastern saw little of the ball and defended in an organised mid-block.
North District managed their first shot on target only about twenty minutes into the match.
Eastern did not manage a single one.</p><p>Towards the end of the first half, Eastern’s players finally woke up.
In one episode, North District centre-back Paez nudged an opponent in the back inside the penalty area.
It looked like a penalty to me, but the referee did not blow his whistle, and VAR backed his decision.
Then, in the 40th minute, the hosts scored.
After a somewhat unnecessary corner kick, Eastern’s Spanish legionnaire Gondra found himself unmarked at the edge of the six-yard box and headed the ball across goal.
Japanese forward Okubo finished the move from almost on the goal line.
It was a fine goal.</p><p>North District equalised before the break — also from a corner.
Arboleda’s cross was headed home by Samuel Granada, who won the aerial duel against Gondra, the hero of the previous episode.</p><p>Immediately after the break, the Sheung Shui side went ahead.
Following a delivery from Villalobos, the ball drifted to the edge of the penalty area.
Paez nodded it back towards the penalty spot.
Eastern defender Callum Hall reached the ball first and seemed to intend to clear it first time.
He did connect first time — but failed to clear it.
The mis-hit ball flew back towards the six-yard box,
where Wong Hoi-Yin (North District) and Almazan (Eastern) both attempted to shoot simultaneously.
Neither succeeded:
Almazan because he swung and missed the ball,
Wong because Almazan swung and missed the ball into his leg.
Wong went down in convulsions, but the referee allowed play to continue
and only blew his whistle after a signal from VAR.
After reviewing the replay, the referee pointed to the spot.
Granada struck firmly into the right corner.
Goalkeeper Cassaro guessed the direction correctly —
but failed to keep the ball out.</p><p>North District continued to dominate,
but for a long time were unable to turn that dominance into chances or goals.
Midway through the half, Kayke David forced Lau Kwan-ching into a loose pass with aggressive pressing, which Weverton intercepted.
The Brazilian burst into the penalty area and went down under a tackle from Cassaro, earning another penalty.
Granada went for the same corner again, but this time Cassaro got down in time and held the ball securely.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, Arboleda won the ball in midfield from Lau Kwan-ching
(the referee ignored a light shove in the back)
and attempted to lob Cassaro, but hit the crossbar.</p><p>In the 73rd minute, North District’s persistence in pressing finally paid off.
Arboleda blocked a pass from Leung Chun-pong in midfield,
Villalobos collected the loose ball, went one-on-one with Cassaro,
and finished past the goalkeeper, frozen in a half-position.</p><p>Two minutes later, Weverton made the scoreline final.
Cassaro punched the ball clear after a corner kick.
Kayke David was first to the rebound and struck a powerful half-volley.
Okubo Yu cleared the ball off the line,
but Weverton was quickest to the rebound
and spectacularly finished with a scissor kick.</p><p>In the remaining minutes, Eastern’s defenders lost the ball several more times during build-up,
but the Sheung Shui side lacked precision in the final action.
4–1 — a convincing win for North District, who cemented their place in the top three.</p><p>It was a bit chilly. I drank two beers.</p><details><summary><b>Eastern — North District 1–4</b><br>Hong Kong Premier League. Matchday 14.

The hosts earned a comeback victory, 2–1.
Goals and highlights are available in the <a href=https://youtu.be/m3P1d0ttg3c>onTV sports</a> recap.</p><p>In the two months since the <a href=/en/2025/11/north-04/>previous entry</a>, North District have played several matches.
On December 4, the Sheung Shui side drew 1–1 with Tai Po.
The match took place a week after the horrific fire in Tai Po that claimed, <a href=https://hongkongfp.com/2026/01/15/breaking-tai-po-fire-death-toll-rises-to-168-following-forensic-analysis-all-bodies-identified/>according to the latest figures</a>, 168 lives.
I attended that game, but have never been in the right mood to write about it.
North District conceded in the second half and equalised in the very first attack after the restart.
A week later, North District lost at home to Kitchee, 1–2.
I did not attend that match because I was teaching that day at the Moscow School.
On December 21, North District also beat Southern District 3–1 in the FA Cup.
I missed that match for no particularly good reason.</p><p>Before this match, North District were two points ahead of Kowloon City, with two games in hand.
In the autumn, the northerners had snatched a draw in Sham Shui Po, which I wrote about in the <a href=/en/2025/10/north-01>first installment</a> of the <em>Northern Suffering</em>.
That match was marred by a serious injury to Kowloon City midfielder Min-gyu Park, whose leg was broken by North District centre-back Carlos Paez.</p><p>The opening phase belonged to the visitors.
As early as the 5th minute, Kowloon opened the scoring.
Khan and Kong Wai Lo failed to track Wan Chun Chiu’s run down the right flank;
from there he delivered a cross into the box, where Kayron won an aerial duel against Ho Yin Wong and scored.</p><p>After conceding, the Sheung Shui took control of the game but were unable to turn their dominance in possession into clear chances.
Kowloon defended with a back five and did not attempt to press high.
North District mostly attacked down the right, but neither long switches nor short combinations found teammates in the final third.</p><p>Kowloon threatened on the counter.
Twice, North District goalkeeper Hoi Man Chung saved his team after dangerous shots on target.
Towards the end of the first half, Chung twice looked uncertain coming off his line,
and only the attackers’ lack of composure prevented the visitors from extending their lead.
In the second incident, Chung picked up an injury and remained on the turf before being carried off on a stretcher.</p><p>The pattern of the game did not change after the break: Kowloon conceded both possession and territory.
In the 57th minute, North District finally equalised.
Samuel Granada reacted quickest amid the chaos at the near post following a corner kick.</p><p>The equaliser did not energise the visitors.
North District continued to put pressure on the right side of Kowloon’s defence,
but their positional attacks bogged down against the organised back line.</p><p>All the more telling, then, that the winning goal came from moving the ball from the flank into the centre, rather than from the centre out wide.
After a Kowloon goal kick, Vinicius Soares contested an aerial duel on the flank near midfield;
the ball dropped to Granada, who one-touched it from the left half-space into the right, to Abadia.
Abadia controlled the ball without losing speed, rounded the goalkeeper, and finished into an empty net.</p><p>In stoppage time, North District were reduced to ten men.
Hiu Chung Lau unsportingly threw away the ball after it had gone out for a throw-in and received a booking, but failed to calm down and became involved in the ensuing <em>baragoz</em>, for which he immediately picked up a second yellow card and was sent off.
Shortly after this burst of passions, the referee blew the final whistle and the match ended.</p><p>The weather was perfect. I absorbed three beers, and then another one after the game.</p><details><summary><b>North District – Kowloon City 2–1</b><br>Hong Kong Premier League, Round 15.

Premier League at Mong Kok Stadium – the very same ground that hosted <a href=/en/2025/10/north-02/>the
match against Kitchee</a>. It finished as a 2–2 draw.
You can watch the goals and key moments in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7U7es_ZfS8">onTV Sports
highlights</a>.</p><p>Lee Man were founded in 2017. The club have never played in the lower Hong
Kong leagues because the owners bought them a Premier League place from the
outset. In 2023–24 they won the league for the first time, and in 2022–23
and 2024–25 they finished runners-up. Once again, North District arrived as
underdogs – all the more so given that a week earlier the teams had met in
the League Cup, where North District lost 1–2 in extra time (I wasn’t at
that match).</p><p>Early on, Lee Man controlled territory and produced a few half-chances. The
Sheung Shui side made some changes on the left flank compared with recent
matches: Chun Ho Wong started in defence, while Jahangir Khan played as a
wide midfielder. However, midway through the first half Wong went off
injured and was replaced by Vinicius Soares, who moved into midfield while
Khan dropped into the back line.</p><p>In the latter stages of the first half North District took the initiative
and scored twice. First, Samuel Granada finished off a cross from Bobby
Singh on the right. Then he swept in a first-time effort from inside the
box after an attack down the left.</p><p>In stoppage time Lee Man pulled one back. After a corner the ball
ricocheted around the six-yard box until, after several rebounds, it found
Tursunov’s foot a metre from North District’s goal. The referee disallowed
the goal (I couldn’t see why) but pointed to the spot: Mikael’s initial
shot had struck Danilo Santos’s arm. Hon Ho Lee guessed correctly but
couldn’t reach it.</p><p>In the second half North District surrendered possession and territory,
dropped the press, and defended in a mid-block in a 4-1-4-1. For the most
part it worked, but in the 57th minute Cy Goddard capitalised on slow
reactions and poor coordination at the back and bundled the ball over the
line.</p><p>The draw held to full time, though North District had two clear chances
late on. First, after a free-kick delivery, Hoi Yin Wong and Danilo Santos
got in each other’s way going for a loose ball. And right before the
whistle, goalkeeper Ka Ho Chan clawed a Villalobos half-volley out of the
bottom right corner.</p><p>North District keep picking up points against strong opponents. In a week
the Sheung Shui side host Tai Po. I didn’t drink at the match, but I made
up for it afterwards.</p><details><summary><b>Lee Man – North District 2–2.</b><br>Hong Kong Premier League, Round 9.

District and Southern District. North District came from behind to win 2–1.</p><p>Southern District had finished fifth in each of the past three seasons, but
this year the team from Aberdeen started poorly — five points from five
games. I expected a laboured, low-scoring game, and that’s exactly what it
turned out to be.</p><p>The match was played at North District Sports Ground in Sheung Shui — the
home ground of North District. It’s a typical Hong Kong district sports
complex with a running track around the pitch and a single stand for
spectators. On ordinary days the stadium is open to the public; you can
even book the pitch for free through a phone app or a terminal right on
site. The stand has no seats, but the entire structure is covered with a
roof against the rain. Unlike Sham Shui Po or Mong Kok, the nearest
7-Eleven is on the way from the MTR station, so no detour is needed. I came
by bike, though, so a detour had to be made. There’s no bag check at the
entrance — as it should be.</p><p>North District had the territorial advantage throughout and created more
chances (see <a href=https://youtu.be/oCE2h7_Fe2c>onTV Sports</a> highlights), but
in the first half the sharper moments came at their own goal. Around the
20th minute, Stefan picked up the ball in the box after a series of
ricochets and shot against the movement of Hon Ho Lee, hitting the post. In
the 35th minute, North District’s press collapsed, Acosta collected the
ball in midfield and played it into the half-space for Stefan, who carried
it into the box and finished neatly into the far corner.</p><p>In the second half, North District’s pressure and the individual skill of
their foreign players produced two goals. In the 72nd minute, Samuel
Granada received a pass from Weverton with his back to goal in the
visitors’ penalty area, turned on the spot, and struck into the top corner.
In the dying minutes, a cross from Vinicius Soares on the right flank was
finished by Kayke David.</p><p>Overall the match was slow-paced, somnambulic. The weather was fine. I
absorbed three beers.</p><details><summary><b>North District – Southern District 2–1.</b><br>Hong Kong Premier League, round 7. North District Sports Ground. 2 November

Kitchee vs. North District in Mong Kok. The match ended in a lively 3–3
draw.</p><p>Kitchee are the most decorated of the current Premier League clubs. Founded
in 1931, they’ve won the Hong Kong championship twelve times — more than
anyone except South China (now playing in the First Division with 41
titles). In the last two seasons, Kitchee finished fourth, well below their
ambitions. So North District were clear underdogs.</p><p>The two sides had already met this season: a month ago, North District beat
Kitchee 3–2 in the Senior Shield quarterfinal — a cup competition among
Premier League teams.</p><p>The match was held at Mong Kok Stadium. Police were patrolling the nearby
streets, and a cordon was set up outside the ground. Fans were searched
before entering — unusual for Premier League matches, at least compared to
other venues (in Sheung Shui, Tai Po, or Sham Shui Po nobody gets
searched). The check wasn’t exactly thorough: I brought in a can of
Guinness in the pockets of my shorts I’d bought during halftime at the
nearest 7-Eleven, having shown the steward my empty backpack.</p><p>Unlike most other Premier League grounds, Mong Kok Stadium is a proper
football stadium — no running track, and stands running all around the
pitch. I watched the match from behind the goal, the best place to observe
players’ movements and defensive transitions.</p><p>Kitchee started on the front foot. They created several chances from wide
attacks but lacked accuracy in finishing. Once the ball did end up in the
North District net, but Juninho’s goal was ruled offside.</p><figure style=width:95%><video controls preload=metadata poster=/posters/20251026_mongkok_1.webp style=max-width:100%;height:auto>

free kick, the ball deflected off North District’s own defender Chun Ho
Wong and into the net. The visitors equalized almost immediately — also
from a set piece — when Han’s cross was met by Samuel Granada. You can
watch all the goals in the highlights by onTV Sports on
<a href=https://youtu.be/Ok11trNvwd4>YouTube</a>.</p><p>The score didn’t change before halftime, though Kitchee had several clear
chances to score. North District’s fullbacks, Chun Ho Wong and Han, often
failed to close down their zones, where Juninho and Mingazov were breaking
through again and again. In the 30th minute, North District midfielder
Hiu Chung Law picked up an injury. After a short pause he came back on and
seemed to have instructions from the coach to drop into the back line
between Danilo Santos and Han when defending. That adjustment helped North
District put out the fire on the left flank.</p><figure style=width:95%><video controls preload=metadata poster=/posters/20251026_mongkok_3.webp style=max-width:100%;height:auto>
<source src=/video/20251026_mongkok_3.mp4 type=video/mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><figcaption>Law drops into the backline</figcaption></figure><p>In the second half, North District grew more aggressive, and chances
started appearing at both ends. The visitors were first to benefit from
this open play in the 66th minute. Villalobos found himself unmarked in
Kitchee’s holding zone, took a bold shot from 30 meters, and the ball went
in off the post.</p><p>North District’s players — especially the foreign ones — celebrated wildly
for a couple of minutes. I thought to myself that such celebrations rarely
end well. And they didn’t: from the very next attack after the kickoff,
Jordan Lam won an aerial duel against Chunho Wong and headed the ball home
after Mingazov’s cross — the Turkmen winger had just outplayed both Han and
Arboleda on the flank.</p><p>In the 78th minute, Kitchee took the lead. Han had pushed almost to the
halfway line to press Mingazov. Kitchee’s center-back Riera lofted a pass
to the corner of the box. Arboleda didn’t reach it; Jordan Lam controlled,
turned, passed to Kendi, who played a one-touch ball into Mingazov’s run.
Hon Ho Lee saved the first shot, but the ball bounced back to the Turkmen forward, and he turned it in while falling — 3:2.</p><p>In the last ten minutes, North District went forward. Kitchee dropped deep
and looked for counters. In the 87th minute, North District won a free kick
near the box. Veverton, Villalobos, and Han had a long discussion — and for
good reason. Han touched the ball to Villalobos, who stopped it as if
setting up Veverton’s run-up, but at the last moment rolled it slightly to
the right. Han spun around, reached the ball in a couple of steps, and
smashed it under the crossbar — straight down the middle; the ball flew
just over Zhen Peng Wang’s gloves and into the net. A crazy goal.</p><p>Nothing remarkable happened in stoppage time. The match ended 3–3. Thanks
to goal difference, North District went top of the table — though by points
dropped, the team from Sheung Shui are only fifth, behind Kitchee, Rangers,
Tai Po, and Lee Man.</p><p>A third of the first stage of the season is now behind. North District have
earned four points in two matches against favorites (Sunday’s draw with
Kitchee and a win over Tai Po in round two) and six points from two games
against clear outsiders, Hong Kong FC. It looks like North District have a
realistic chance at a top-five finish — and a place in the Championship
Group after the split. If only they could put out the fire on the flanks.</p><details><summary><b>Kitchee v North District 3–3.</b><br>Hong Kong Premier League, Round 6.

District players. Luizinho won an aerial duel against Chun Ho Wong, nodded
the ball to Tsz Hin Loong, and moved to support. Arboleda blocked the pass
to the left, but Luizinho picked up the rebound and played it to Min-gyu
Park. The Korean slowed down and found the back of the net with a stunning
strike.</p><figure style=width:95%><video controls preload=metadata poster=/posters/20251019_shamshuipo_1.webp style=max-width:100%;height:auto>

two opponents to reach the rebound first. Samuel Granada finished

created the better chances. In added time, Kowloon players collectively
failed in midfield, leaving Vinicius Soares and Chun Ho Wong unmarked in

back to Arboleda, who found the net from near the penalty spot. Remarkably,

Over the
past year living here, I’ve run into (and tried not to step on) countless
snails, toads, and lizards. People have warned me about snakes, but I
haven’t seen one yet. And I have never expected to encounter a
<em>fish</em> — fish inhabit bodies of water, and paths are not part of
those. And yet, there it was: a fish, lying in the middle of the path.</p><figure><img src=/images/channa.webp width=560px height=auto loading=lazy decoding=async alt="A fish on the path"><figcaption>A fish lying on the path</figcaption></figure><p>I decided to move the fish from the path into the puddle. First, I figured
it might suffocate without water. Second, one of the stray dogs — the ones
the neighbours feed — might eat it. Third, it could get run over by
a motorcycle. In short, I was concerned for the fish’s life.</p><p>I picked two leaves off a bush to use like napkins, and lifted the fish off
the ground. The fish suddenly slipped out of my hands, flopped back down,
and wriggled into the puddle — exactly where I’d meant to put
it. So, nothing worked, and everything worked.</p><h3 align=center>* * *</h3><p>Most likely, it was a snakehead (<em>Channa</em>). Snakeheads live in still water,
can breathe air, and are capable of moving between ponds over land. It’s
been <a href=https://hongkongfp.com/2025/07/10/storm-danas-hong-kong-hoists-third-amber-rain-signal-in-24-hrs-schools-suspended-friday/>raining
heavily</a>
since last night here in Hong Kong — which probably explains how the fish
ended up in our little frog pond. Saving a snakehead from suffocating was
an act of ignorance — but saving it from a dog or a motorcycle
made perfect sense.</p><footer><p>Tags:

leagues) tiers of the football pyramid in Russia. It has a rather
whimsical format.</p><p>From the 2023-2024 season onwards, the second league has been split into
two divisions. Division B is divided in 4 groups, largely on a geographic
basis. Teams play a double round-robin tournament from spring to autumn.
The group winners are promoted to the ‘Silver’ group of the Division A.</p><p>Division A comprises 20 teams, which are divided into the ‘Gold’ and
‘Silver’ groups. Teams play from autumn to spring. The season is split
into separate autumn and spring parts. Both parts are double round-robin
competitions.</p><p>After the <strong>autumn part</strong> of the season, the top four Silver teams are
promoted to Gold. The bottom two teams are relegated to Division B, while
the teams in seventh and eighth place play relegation play-offs against
the bottom two teams from the spring part of the competition. The losers
of these play-offs are also relegated to Division B.</p><p>If a team that finished in the bottom two in the spring part of the
competition finishes in 7th or 8th place, they are relegated without
play-offs. If a team that finished in the bottom two in the spring part
earns promotion in the autumn, they do not play in the play-offs but are
promoted to Gold instead. Instead, the team in eighth place at the end of
the autumn part is eliminated without play-offs. If both teams in the
bottom two earn promotion, then the bottom four teams in the autumn part
are eliminated without play-offs.</p><p>The bottom four Gold teams are relegated to Silver. The group winner
earns the right to play in the promotion play-offs.</p><p>After the <strong>spring part</strong> of the season, no Silver team is relegated; the
bottom two play relegation play-offs after the autumn part (see
above). The top four teams are promoted to Gold. The bottom four Gold
teams are relegated to Silver.</p><p>The top two Gold teams are promoted to the First League. The third team
plays the autumn winner in a promotion play-off. If the autumn winner
secures a place in the top three, then the top three teams are promoted
automatically. If the autumn winner finishes in the bottom four in the
spring part, they are relegated to Silver. The runners-up or the third
place teams take their place in the promotion play-offs (but only if they
did not finish in the top two or bottom four in the spring). If the top
three teams remain the same after the autumn and spring parts or if all
autumn top-three teams are relegated, then the spring top three promotes
to the First League.</p></details><p>After conceding a goal in the 79th minute, FC Chelyabinsk had a number of
scoring chances, but completely gave up on progressing their possession
in injury time. They passively passed the ball in their own half.</p><p>If Chelyabinsk equalised, they would earn 27 points, which would put them
in level with Volgar and Leningradets, provided they won their

a student of Theodor Adorno.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Adorno supervised</strong> the work on sport of Heinz Risse whose <em>Soziologie
