Kitchee vs. North District in Mong Kok. The match ended in a lively 3–3
draw.</p><p>Kitchee are the most decorated of the current Premier League clubs. Founded
in 1931, they’ve won the Hong Kong championship twelve times — more than
anyone except South China (now playing in the First Division with 41
titles). In the last two seasons, Kitchee finished fourth, well below their
ambitions. So North District were clear underdogs.</p><p>The two sides had already met this season: a month ago, North District beat
Kitchee 3–2 in the Senior Shield quarterfinal — a cup competition among
Premier League teams.</p><p>The match was held at Mong Kok Stadium. Police were patrolling the nearby
streets, and a cordon was set up outside the ground. Fans were searched
before entering — unusual for Premier League matches, at least compared to
other venues (in Sheung Shui, Tai Po, or Sham Shui Po nobody gets
searched). The check wasn’t exactly thorough: I brought in a can of
Guinness in the pockets of my shorts I’d bought during halftime at the
nearest 7-Eleven, having shown the steward my empty backpack.</p><p>Unlike most other Premier League grounds, Mong Kok Stadium is a proper
football stadium — no running track, and stands running all around the
pitch. I watched the match from behind the goal, the best place to observe
players’ movements and defensive transitions.</p><p>Kitchee started on the front foot. They created several chances from wide
attacks but lacked accuracy in finishing. Once the ball did end up in the
North District net, but Juninho’s goal was ruled offside.</p><figure style=width:95%><video controls preload=metadata poster=/posters/20251026_mongkok_1.webp style=max-width:100%;height:auto>

free kick, the ball deflected off North District’s own defender Chun Ho
Wong and into the net. The visitors equalized almost immediately — also
from a set piece — when Han’s cross was met by Samuel Granada. You can
watch all the goals in the highlights by onTV Sports on
<a href=https://youtu.be/Ok11trNvwd4>YouTube</a>.</p><p>The score didn’t change before halftime, though Kitchee had several clear
chances to score. North District’s fullbacks, Chun Ho Wong and Han, often
failed to close down their zones, where Juninho and Mingazov were breaking
through again and again. In the 30th minute, North District midfielder
Hiu Chung Law picked up an injury. After a short pause he came back on and
seemed to have instructions from the coach to drop into the back line
between Danilo Santos and Han when defending. That adjustment helped North
District put out the fire on the left flank.</p><figure style=width:95%><video controls preload=metadata poster=/posters/20251026_mongkok_3.webp style=max-width:100%;height:auto>
<source src=/video/20251026_mongkok_3.mp4 type=video/mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><figcaption>Law drops into the backline</figcaption></figure><p>In the second half, North District grew more aggressive, and chances
started appearing at both ends. The visitors were first to benefit from
this open play in the 66th minute. Villalobos found himself unmarked in
Kitchee’s holding zone, took a bold shot from 30 meters, and the ball went
in off the post.</p><p>North District’s players — especially the foreign ones — celebrated wildly
for a couple of minutes. I thought to myself that such celebrations rarely
end well. And they didn’t: from the very next attack after the kickoff,
Jordan Lam won an aerial duel against Chunho Wong and headed the ball home
after Mingazov’s cross — the Turkmen winger had just outplayed both Han and
Arboleda on the flank.</p><p>In the 78th minute, Kitchee took the lead. Han had pushed almost to the
halfway line to press Mingazov. Kitchee’s center-back Riera lofted a pass
to the corner of the box. Arboleda didn’t reach it; Jordan Lam controlled,
turned, passed to Kendi, who played a one-touch ball into Mingazov’s run.
Hon Ho Lee saved the first shot, but the ball bounced back to the Turkmen forward, and he turned it in while falling — 3:2.</p><p>In the last ten minutes, North District went forward. Kitchee dropped deep
and looked for counters. In the 87th minute, North District won a free kick
near the box. Veverton, Villalobos, and Han had a long discussion — and for
good reason. Han touched the ball to Villalobos, who stopped it as if
setting up Veverton’s run-up, but at the last moment rolled it slightly to
the right. Han spun around, reached the ball in a couple of steps, and
smashed it under the crossbar — straight down the middle; the ball flew
just over Zhen Peng Wang’s gloves and into the net. A crazy goal.</p><p>Nothing remarkable happened in stoppage time. The match ended 3–3. Thanks
to goal difference, North District went top of the table — though by points
dropped, the team from Sheung Shui are only fifth, behind Kitchee, Rangers,
Tai Po, and Lee Man.</p><p>A third of the first stage of the season is now behind. North District have
earned four points in two matches against favorites (Sunday’s draw with
Kitchee and a win over Tai Po in round two) and six points from two games
against clear outsiders, Hong Kong FC. It looks like North District have a
realistic chance at a top-five finish — and a place in the Championship
Group after the split. If only they could put out the fire on the flanks.</p><details><summary><b>Kitchee v North District 3–3.</b><br>Hong Kong Premier League, Round 6.

Kowloon City and North District at Sham Shui Po. The game ended in a 2–2
draw.</p><p>The Sheung Shui side took an early advantage with aggressive pressing in
the attacking third. Kowloon players frequently misplaced passes in their
own half. However, it was Kowloon who opened the scoring in the 18th
minute, punishing the opposition for committing too many players forward.</p><p>Kowloon played long from a goal kick, clearing the ball over six (!) North
District players. Luizinho won an aerial duel against Chun Ho Wong, nodded
the ball to Tsz Hin Loong, and moved to support. Arboleda blocked the pass
to the left, but Luizinho picked up the rebound and played it to Min-gyu
Park. The Korean slowed down and found the back of the net with a stunning
strike.</p><figure style=width:95%><video controls preload=metadata poster=/posters/20251019_shamshuipo_1.webp style=max-width:100%;height:auto>

to stop a counter-attack with a sliding tackle from behind and seriously
injured Min-gyu Park. Park was stretchered off, while Paez was sent off
after a VAR review. Chun Ting Lee replaced Park, and North District’s
holding midfielder Elian Villalobos dropped into defence.</p><p>Kowloon City extended their lead at the start of the second half from the
corner kick. Kessi shook off Samuel Granada and beat Villalobos in the air
at the near post.</p><figure style=width:95%><video controls preload=metadata poster=/posters/20251019_shamshuipo_2.webp style=max-width:100%;height:auto>

attacking substitutions: Hiu Chung Law replaced Kong Wai Lo, and Weverton
came on for Kayke David. In the 63rd minute, Weverton’s long-range effort
forced home goalkeeper Ho Chun Yuen to parry the ball straight in front of
him. Kowloon’s central defenders completely lost their bearings, allowing
two opponents to reach the rebound first. Samuel Granada finished
clinically from close range.</p><figure style=width:95%><video controls preload=metadata poster=/posters/20251019_shamshuipo_3.webp style=max-width:100%;height:auto>

created the better chances. In added time, Kowloon players collectively
failed in midfield, leaving Vinicius Soares and Chun Ho Wong unmarked in
the holding zone. After overlapping to the right flank, Wong cut the ball
back to Arboleda, who found the net from near the penalty spot. Remarkably,
Arboleda had started the move by picking up the ball after a foul on
Weverton.</p><figure style=width:95%><video controls preload=metadata poster=/posters/20251019_shamshuipo_4.webp style=max-width:100%;height:auto>

Over the
past year living here, I’ve run into (and tried not to step on) countless
snails, toads, and lizards. People have warned me about snakes, but I
haven’t seen one yet. And I have never expected to encounter a
<em>fish</em> — fish inhabit bodies of water, and paths are not part of
those. And yet, there it was: a fish, lying in the middle of the path.</p><figure><img src=/images/channa.webp width=560px height=auto loading=lazy decoding=async alt="A fish on the path"><figcaption>A fish lying on the path</figcaption></figure><p>I decided to move the fish from the path into the puddle. First, I figured
it might suffocate without water. Second, one of the stray dogs — the ones
the neighbours feed — might eat it. Third, it could get run over by
a motorcycle. In short, I was concerned for the fish’s life.</p><p>I picked two leaves off a bush to use like napkins, and lifted the fish off
the ground. The fish suddenly slipped out of my hands, flopped back down,
and wriggled into the puddle — exactly where I’d meant to put
it. So, nothing worked, and everything worked.</p><h3 align=center>* * *</h3><p>Most likely, it was a snakehead (<em>Channa</em>). Snakeheads live in still water,
can breathe air, and are capable of moving between ponds over land. It’s
been <a href=https://hongkongfp.com/2025/07/10/storm-danas-hong-kong-hoists-third-amber-rain-signal-in-24-hrs-schools-suspended-friday/>raining
heavily</a>
since last night here in Hong Kong — which probably explains how the fish
ended up in our little frog pond. Saving a snakehead from suffocating was
an act of ignorance — but saving it from a dog or a motorcycle
made perfect sense.</p><footer><p>Tags:

leagues) tiers of the football pyramid in Russia. It has a rather
whimsical format.</p><p>From the 2023-2024 season onwards, the second league has been split into
two divisions. Division B is divided in 4 groups, largely on a geographic
basis. Teams play a double round-robin tournament from spring to autumn.
The group winners are promoted to the ‘Silver’ group of the Division A.</p><p>Division A comprises 20 teams, which are divided into the ‘Gold’ and
‘Silver’ groups. Teams play from autumn to spring. The season is split
into separate autumn and spring parts. Both parts are double round-robin
competitions.</p><p>After the <strong>autumn part</strong> of the season, the top four Silver teams are
promoted to Gold. The bottom two teams are relegated to Division B, while
the teams in seventh and eighth place play relegation play-offs against
the bottom two teams from the spring part of the competition. The losers
of these play-offs are also relegated to Division B.</p><p>If a team that finished in the bottom two in the spring part of the
competition finishes in 7th or 8th place, they are relegated without
play-offs. If a team that finished in the bottom two in the spring part
earns promotion in the autumn, they do not play in the play-offs but are
promoted to Gold instead. Instead, the team in eighth place at the end of
the autumn part is eliminated without play-offs. If both teams in the
bottom two earn promotion, then the bottom four teams in the autumn part
are eliminated without play-offs.</p><p>The bottom four Gold teams are relegated to Silver. The group winner
earns the right to play in the promotion play-offs.</p><p>After the <strong>spring part</strong> of the season, no Silver team is relegated; the
bottom two play relegation play-offs after the autumn part (see
above). The top four teams are promoted to Gold. The bottom four Gold
teams are relegated to Silver.</p><p>The top two Gold teams are promoted to the First League. The third team
plays the autumn winner in a promotion play-off. If the autumn winner
secures a place in the top three, then the top three teams are promoted
automatically. If the autumn winner finishes in the bottom four in the
spring part, they are relegated to Silver. The runners-up or the third
place teams take their place in the promotion play-offs (but only if they
did not finish in the top two or bottom four in the spring). If the top
three teams remain the same after the autumn and spring parts or if all
autumn top-three teams are relegated, then the spring top three promotes
to the First League.</p></details><p>After conceding a goal in the 79th minute, FC Chelyabinsk had a number of
scoring chances, but completely gave up on progressing their possession
in injury time. They passively passed the ball in their own half.</p><p>If Chelyabinsk equalised, they would earn 27 points, which would put them
in level with Volgar and Leningradets, provided they won their
respective matches against Rodina-2 Moscow and Spartak Kostroma. If so,

promotion. Perhaps Volgar will refer to this clause to justify their right
to participate in the promotion playoff. So far, Football National League

of licences for FC Chelyabinsk and Mashuk-KMV from the Russian Football
Union.</p><hr><p>FC Volga Ulyanovsk secured second place in the Division A. Next season,
they will play in the First League for the third time in their history.

of the sociology of sport. Dunning repeatedly refers to Heinz Risse, the
author of what appears to be the first monograph to feature the phrase
&lsquo;sociology of sport&rsquo; in the title (<em>Sociologie des Sports</em>, 1921), as
a student of Theodor Adorno.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Adorno supervised</strong> the work on sport of Heinz Risse whose <em>Soziologie
des Sports</em> (1921) was, so far as I know, the first time that this
subdiscipline was explicitly named. Adorno also supervised the work
of Bero Rigauer which resulted in <em>Sport und Arbeit</em> (Sport and
Work) (1969).<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To my knowledge, the sociology of sport first emerged as a specific,
named endeavour and the subject of a book-length study in 1921 when
Heinz Risse, <strong>a student of Theodor Adorno</strong>, published his
<em>Soziologie des Sports</em>.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Adorno was five years younger than Risse and had only just entered the
university in 1921. Risse&rsquo;s supervisor in the early 1920s <a href=http://www.rheinische-geschichte.lvr.de/p.rsoenlichkeiten/heinz-risse/DE-2086/lido/57cd205c6941a8.50270161>was Alfred
Weber</a>.</p><p>Dunning&rsquo;s co-author, Jay Coakley, repeats this error in his pieces on the
sociology of sport for <a href=https://www.hse.ru/data/2010/01/20/1229135498/Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Sociology%20Vol%205.pdf><em>The Encyclopedia of

Sociology</em></a> (Vol. 1, p. 368).</p><p>Dunning and Coakley co-edited the collection <em>Handbook of Sports Studies</em>
(2000). There, Risse is also referred to as Adorno&rsquo;s student (p. xxii),
although the collection features Klaus Heinemann&rsquo;s piece on the development
of the sociology in Germany, which mentions (p. 536) Risse (without
biographic details).</p><p>Thence, always double-check. Even the classics.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Eric Dunning, <em>Sport Matters, Sociological Studies of Sport,
