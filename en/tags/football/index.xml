&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attended the Hong Kong Premier League fifth-round match between
Kowloon City and North District at Sham Shui Po. The game ended in a 2–2
draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sheung Shui side took an early advantage with aggressive pressing in
the attacking third. Kowloon players frequently misplaced passes in their
own half. However, it was Kowloon who opened the scoring in the 18th
minute, punishing the opposition for committing too many players forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Choose to lose</title><link>https://rmatv.github.io/en/2025/06/choose-to-lose/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 06:43:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://rmatv.github.io/en/2025/06/choose-to-lose/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;14 June saw the final matchday in the Second Russia football league
(Division A). Trailing 2-1 at home to Mashuk-KMV, FC Chelyabinsk &lt;a href="https://vk.com/video-139174916_456244374?t=2h4m5s"&gt;spent the
final minute of the match passing the ball in their own
half&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was the imperfections in the league rules that caused
FC Chelyabinsk to choose to lose rather than attempt to equalise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FC Chelybinsk won the spring part of the season and enter the final week at
third, two points ahead of Mashuk-KMV, Volgar and Leningradets. A
five-point advantage over Veles secured the team a place in the promotion
play-offs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
