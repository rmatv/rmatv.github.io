&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, I attended the sixth round of the Hong Kong Premier League —
Kitchee vs. North District in Mong Kok. The match ended in a lively 3–3
draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitchee are the most decorated of the current Premier League clubs. Founded
in 1931, they’ve won the Hong Kong championship twelve times — more than
anyone except South China (now playing in the First Division with 41
titles). In the last two seasons, Kitchee finished fourth, well below their
ambitions. So North District were clear underdogs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Northern suffering (#1): Kowloon City v North District</title><link>https://rmatv.github.io/en/2025/10/north-01/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 10:16:08 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://rmatv.github.io/en/2025/10/north-01/</guid><description>&lt;figure style="width:95%;height:auto"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attended the Hong Kong Premier League fifth-round match between
Kowloon City and North District at Sham Shui Po. The game ended in a 2–2
draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sheung Shui side took an early advantage with aggressive pressing in
the attacking third. Kowloon players frequently misplaced passes in their
own half. However, it was Kowloon who opened the scoring in the 18th
minute, punishing the opposition for committing too many players forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Choose to lose</title><link>https://rmatv.github.io/en/2025/06/choose-to-lose/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 06:43:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://rmatv.github.io/en/2025/06/choose-to-lose/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;14 June saw the final matchday in the Second Russia football league
(Division A). Trailing 2-1 at home to Mashuk-KMV, FC Chelyabinsk &lt;a href="https://vk.com/video-139174916_456244374?t=2h4m5s"&gt;spent the
final minute of the match passing the ball in their own
half&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was the imperfections in the league rules that caused
FC Chelyabinsk to choose to lose rather than attempt to equalise.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
