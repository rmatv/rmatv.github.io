The visitors won 4–1.
Goals and highlights can be watched in the <a href=https://youtu.be/v1YINFSr6wU>onTV Sports review</a>.</p><p>Eastern are the oldest<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> of the current Premier League participants.
The club have been champions of Hong Kong five times:
four times before the establishment of the Premier League (1955–56, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1994–95) and once after (2015–16).
Eastern have also won the FA Cup seven times, including the last two editions of the tournament.</p><p>This year, things have not gone well for the team.
In the AFC Champions League Two, Eastern lost all six matches with a goal difference of 2–30.
They lost 0–7 at home to Thailand’s Ratchaburi and 0–9 away to Vietnam’s Nam Dinh.
Things are no better domestically either: last weekend Lee Man demolished Eastern 8–1.</p><p>North District had beaten Eastern District away 2–0 over the weekend (I didn’t attend that match) and came into this game as favourites — something I’m still not used to (and would rather not get used to).</p><p>The game started dull. It then continued in much the same vein.
North District enjoyed plenty of possession and tried to create danger down the flanks.
The forwards and wingers languished offside, as if they had collectively forgotten the offside rule.
Eastern saw little of the ball and defended in an organised mid-block.
North District managed their first shot on target only about twenty minutes into the match.
Eastern did not manage a single one.</p><p>Towards the end of the first half, Eastern’s players finally woke up.
In one episode, North District centre-back Paez nudged an opponent in the back inside the penalty area.
It looked like a penalty to me, but the referee did not blow his whistle, and VAR backed his decision.
Then, in the 40th minute, the hosts scored.
After a somewhat unnecessary corner kick, Eastern’s Spanish legionnaire Gondra found himself unmarked at the edge of the six-yard box and headed the ball across goal.
Japanese forward Okubo finished the move from almost on the goal line.
It was a fine goal.</p><p>North District equalised before the break — also from a corner.
Arboleda’s cross was headed home by Samuel Granada, who won the aerial duel against Gondra, the hero of the previous episode.</p><p>Immediately after the break, the Sheung Shui side went ahead.
Following a delivery from Villalobos, the ball drifted to the edge of the penalty area.
Paez nodded it back towards the penalty spot.
Eastern defender Callum Hall reached the ball first and seemed to intend to clear it first time.
He did connect first time — but failed to clear it.
The mis-hit ball flew back towards the six-yard box,
where Wong Hoi-Yin (North District) and Almazan (Eastern) both attempted to shoot simultaneously.
Neither succeeded:
Almazan because he swung and missed the ball,
Wong because Almazan swung and missed the ball into his leg.
Wong went down in convulsions, but the referee allowed play to continue
and only blew his whistle after a signal from VAR.
After reviewing the replay, the referee pointed to the spot.
Granada struck firmly into the right corner.
Goalkeeper Cassaro guessed the direction correctly —
but failed to keep the ball out.</p><p>North District continued to dominate,
but for a long time were unable to turn that dominance into chances or goals.
Midway through the half, Kayke David forced Lau Kwan-ching into a loose pass with aggressive pressing, which Weverton intercepted.
The Brazilian burst into the penalty area and went down under a tackle from Cassaro, earning another penalty.
Granada went for the same corner again, but this time Cassaro got down in time and held the ball securely.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, Arboleda won the ball in midfield from Lau Kwan-ching
(the referee ignored a light shove in the back)
and attempted to lob Cassaro, but hit the crossbar.</p><p>In the 73rd minute, North District’s persistence in pressing finally paid off.
Arboleda blocked a pass from Leung Chun-pong in midfield,
Villalobos collected the loose ball, went one-on-one with Cassaro,
and finished past the goalkeeper, frozen in a half-position.</p><p>Two minutes later, Weverton made the scoreline final.
Cassaro punched the ball clear after a corner kick.
Kayke David was first to the rebound and struck a powerful half-volley.
Okubo Yu cleared the ball off the line,
but Weverton was quickest to the rebound
and spectacularly finished with a scissor kick.</p><p>In the remaining minutes, Eastern’s defenders lost the ball several more times during build-up,
but the Sheung Shui side lacked precision in the final action.
4–1 — a convincing win for North District, who cemented their place in the top three.</p><p>It was a bit chilly. I drank two beers.</p><details><summary><b>Eastern — North District 1–4</b><br>Hong Kong Premier League. Matchday 14.
