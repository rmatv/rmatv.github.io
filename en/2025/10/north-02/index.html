Kitchee vs. North District in Mong Kok. The match ended in a lively 3–3
draw.</p><p>Kitchee are the most decorated of the current Premier League clubs. Founded
in 1931, they’ve won the Hong Kong championship twelve times — more than
anyone except South China (now playing in the First Division with 41
titles). In the last two seasons, Kitchee finished fourth, well below their
ambitions. So North District were clear underdogs.</p><p>The two sides had already met this season: a month ago, North District beat
Kitchee 3–2 in the Senior Shield quarterfinal — a cup competition among
Premier League teams.</p><p>The match was held at Mong Kok Stadium. Police were patrolling the nearby
streets, and a cordon was set up outside the ground. Fans were searched
before entering — unusual for Premier League matches, at least compared to
other venues (in Sheung Shui, Tai Po, or Sham Shui Po nobody gets
searched). The check wasn’t exactly thorough: I brought in a can of
Guinness in the pockets of my shorts I’d bought during halftime at the
nearest 7-Eleven, having shown the steward my empty backpack.</p><p>Unlike most other Premier League grounds, Mong Kok Stadium is a proper
football stadium — no running track, and stands running all around the
pitch. I watched the match from behind the goal, the best place to observe
players’ movements and defensive transitions.</p><p>Kitchee started on the front foot. They created several chances from wide
attacks but lacked accuracy in finishing. Once the ball did end up in the
North District net, but Juninho’s goal was ruled offside.</p><figure><video width=100% height=auto controls>

free kick, the ball deflected off North District’s own defender Chun Ho
Wong and into the net. The visitors equalized almost immediately — also
from a set piece — when Han’s cross was met by Samuel Granada. You can
watch all the goals in the highlights by onTV Sports on
<a href=https://youtu.be/Ok11trNvwd4>YouTube</a>.</p><p>The score didn’t change before halftime, though Kitchee had several clear
chances to score. North District’s fullbacks, Chun Ho Wong and Han, often
failed to close down their zones, where Juninho and Mingazov were breaking
through again and again. In the 30th minute, North District midfielder
Hiu Chung Law picked up an injury. After a short pause he came back on and
seemed to have instructions from the coach to drop into the back line
between Danilo Santos and Han when defending. That adjustment helped North
District put out the fire on the left flank.</p><figure><img src=/images/20251026_nor_kit_1.webp alt="Law drops into the back line"><figcaption>Law drops into the back line</figcaption></figure><figure><video width=100% height=auto controls>

started appearing at both ends. The visitors were first to benefit from
this open play in the 66th minute. Villalobos found himself unmarked in
Kitchee’s holding zone, took a bold shot from 30 meters, and the ball went
in off the post.</p><p>North District’s players — especially the foreign ones — celebrated wildly
for a couple of minutes. I thought to myself that such celebrations rarely
end well. And they didn’t: from the very next attack after the kickoff,
Jordan Lam won an aerial duel against Chunho Wong and headed the ball home
after Mingazov’s cross — the Turkmen winger had just outplayed both Han and
Arboleda on the flank.</p><p>In the 78th minute, Kitchee took the lead. Han had pushed almost to the
halfway line to press Mingazov. Kitchee’s center-back Riera lofted a pass
to the corner of the box. Arboleda didn’t reach it; Jordan Lam controlled,
turned, passed to Kendi, who played a one-touch ball into Mingazov’s run.
Hon Ho Lee saved the first shot, but the ball bounced back to the Turkmen forward, and he turned it in while falling — 3:2.</p><p>In the last ten minutes, North District went forward. Kitchee dropped deep
and looked for counters. In the 87th minute, North District won a free kick
near the box. Veverton, Villalobos, and Han had a long discussion — and for
good reason. Han touched the ball to Villalobos, who stopped it as if
setting up Veverton’s run-up, but at the last moment rolled it slightly to
the right. Han spun around, reached the ball in a couple of steps, and
smashed it under the crossbar — straight down the middle; the ball flew
just over Zhen Peng Wang’s gloves and into the net. A crazy goal.</p><p>Nothing remarkable happened in stoppage time. The match ended 3–3. Thanks
to goal difference, North District went top of the table — though by points
dropped, the team from Sheung Shui are only fifth, behind Kitchee, Rangers,
Tai Po, and Lee Man.</p><p>A third of the first stage of the season is now behind. North District have
earned four points in two matches against favorites (Sunday’s draw with
Kitchee and a win over Tai Po in round two) and six points from two games
against clear outsiders, Hong Kong FC. It looks like North District have a
realistic chance at a top-five finish — and a place in the Championship
Group after the split. If only they could put out the fire on the flanks.</p><details><summary><b>Kitchee v North District 3–3.</b><br>Hong Kong Premier League, Round 6.
