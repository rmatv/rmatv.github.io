Over the
past year living here, I’ve run into (and tried not to step on) countless
snails, toads, and lizards. People have warned me about snakes, but I
haven’t seen one yet. And I have never expected to encounter a
<em>fish</em> — fish inhabit bodies of water, and paths are not part of
those. And yet, there it was: a fish, lying in the middle of the path.</p><figure><img src=/images/channa.webp><caption>A fish lying on the path</caption></figure><p>I decided to move the fish from the path into the puddle. First, I figured
it might suffocate without water. Second, one of the stray dogs — the ones
the neighbours feed — might eat it. Third, it could get run over by
a motorcycle. In short, I was concerned for the fish’s life.</p><p>I picked two leaves off a bush to use like napkins, and lifted the fish off
the ground. The fish suddenly slipped out of my hands, flopped back down,
and wriggled into the puddle — exactly where I’d meant to put
it. So, nothing worked, and everything worked.</p><h3 align=center>* * *</h3><p>Most likely, it was a snakehead (<em>Channa</em>). Snakeheads live in still water,
can breathe air, and are capable of moving between ponds over land. It’s
been <a href=https://hongkongfp.com/2025/07/10/storm-danas-hong-kong-hoists-third-amber-rain-signal-in-24-hrs-schools-suspended-friday/>raining
heavily</a>
since last night here in Hong Kong — which probably explains how the fish
ended up in our little frog pond. Saving a snakehead from suffocating was
an act of ignorance — but saving it from a dog or a motorcycle
made perfect sense.</p><footer><p>Tags:
