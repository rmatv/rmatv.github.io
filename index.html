      <p>I am currently a PhD sociology student at the Chinese University
      of Hong Kong, writing a dissertation on association football. It is
      a video-based ethnomethodological study. Through a detailed analysis
      of match footage, I demonstrate that recognizing and anticipating the
      actions of others is crucial for the successful execution of both
      simple plays and complex team efforts. The study aims to provide an
      empirically grounded, interactionist perspective on coordination,
      antagonism, and decision-making.</p> 

      <p>I played amateur football and rugby union but have now retired to
      leisurely walking and non-competitive cycling. Outside of sport, my
      interests include science and crime fiction, urban nature, and
      tactical video games.</p>
